              This short novel is an absolute classic. It may seem at first it is quite slow but the author knows what she is doing. Once you are able to capture the gist of the characters, what they do for a living, and their ideals you will surely not be able to put this book down.

            The Fault in Our Stars is a classic masterpiece written by John Green that tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, who has had cancer for 3 years, and Augustus Waters, a 17-year-old who had a tumor in his leg. The two fall in love, even though they know their story will only end with a sad ending. It takes you on a ride of emotions, it is warm, light-hearted, sad, and also deals with a sensitive topic like cancer in such a subtle way.

            <p>
              A young boy, 15, who has gone through a life changing and traumatizing experience which will later be part of history. This novel written by Wiesel describes his time during the Holocaust in such vivid descriptions. Wiesel goes on to write about his separation from his family and essentially life as a Jewish prisoner on concentration camps. Reading this novel in a way makes a person rethink decisions to be kinder to people and not discriminate towards others. Humanity is such a beautiful thing but dehumanizing another being will destroy something so precious.
