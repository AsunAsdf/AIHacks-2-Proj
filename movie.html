            <br> V for Vendetta
            <br>
            <br> Director: James McTeigue
            <br>

            <p>
              This film has such a deeper meaning to how the government can influence the people to believe they can’t do much. V in whom the main character believes in punishing the bad which at times requires violence. I absolutely would recommend this movie if you have an interest in vengeance and heroism.

              Coco is an animated movie about a young boy named Miguel who aspires to be like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz. This is a beautiful movie, for it signifies the unbreakable bond between a father and his daughter. We also get to learn moral values such as love, kindness, dedication and passion. Coco is a must watch.

             The animated film Coraline is to say the least one of the creepiest but intriguing films I’ve watched as a child. Although it may not be recommended to be shown to the younger audience due to some disturbing images. Coraline is about a young girl who has had to move to a new town to which she finds no interest in. While trying to relieve her boredom she comes acquainted with this mysterious door which leads to a parallel universe. Little does she know she will experience an adventure she will want to end.
